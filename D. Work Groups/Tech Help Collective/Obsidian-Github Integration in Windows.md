As you know you control Obsidian from your GitHub repository. Both of these platforms have Windows Programs you can use from the comfort of your desk(top).

This guide will explain how you can get your GitHub repo as a folder to your computer, download and setup Obsidian, connect Obsidian to your downloaded GitHub folder and finally push the changes to GitHub and consequently update Obsidian page.

## 1.      GitHub Installation

You can find the installation file of the GitHub in the following link; [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

After the installation, program will prompt you to login screen where you can login with your credentials. If you skip this part mistakenly you can find the login screen from “File -> Options -> Accounts” page. After this you will see the following screen;

In here you will choose the ‘Clone a repository from the Internet’. This will show you the available repositories you can download to your computer. Default path for this folder will be under “C:\Documents\GitHub” folder (We will be using this folder location later).

Before we are done with the GitHub part of the guide, there is one more thing we have to install from the following link; [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

During the installation of this software, you can leave all the options in their default state. Make sure the following option is selected for path environment. Again, it is like this by default, but no harm in being cautious.

Now we can go to the next step.

## 2.      Obsidian Installation

You can download Obsidian from the following link; [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download)

(This part is over. It doesn’t even ask you anything.)

  

## 3.      Obsidian-GitHub Connection

When you open Obsidian for the first time you will see the following screen;
![[Pasted image 20220614173142.png]]

Here you have to select ‘Open folder as vault’ and select the folder you have downloaded from GitHub in the first step.

After this go to Settings from the bottom left corner and select Community Plugins. Safe Mode is enabled by default here, turn it off. Now, you can search for Obsidian Git plugin.

Make sure the plugin is enabled after the installation. With the help of this plugin you can add, delete or edit the pages and then publish them to your GitHub. In the plugin’s Options page make sure ‘Pull updates on startup’ option is enabled and ‘Disable push’ option is disabled. You can tweak the other setting however you like.

## 4.      Making Changes

Before you do any changes, you will want to setup some hotkeys for the plugin. Choose any hotkey you want to any setting you want. But most important settings are Commit, Pull, and Push commands. Make sure you have any kind of hotkey for these settings to ease your usage.

In the homepage of the Obsidian, you will see all the pages. Let’s say you want to edit a certain document. Just open the document and make the changes you want. When you are done press the hotkey for the Push command and then Commit command. You will see these commands have gone through from the notification coming from the upper right of the program. With the same way you can add a new page, create folders, sort the pages, etc.
