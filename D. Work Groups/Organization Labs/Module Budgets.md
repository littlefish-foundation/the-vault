#orglabs 

Each proposal is made up of [modules](https://publish.obsidian.md/littlefish-foundation/D.+Work+Groups/Organizational+Structure#Modules). Each module has a specified budget. The sum of module budgets makes up the first part of the overall budget.

1.  **Personnel budget**
   
    Each module has a personnel budget and an operations budget. The personnel budget is the total estimated hours * the hourly rate for the module.  
      
    The base hourly rate for LFF proposals is 50 USD. This is a living wage in most parts of the world. It will bring financial stability to participants.  
      
    The hourly rate for a module may change from this default, based on the expertise needed.  
      
    
2.  **Module operations budget**  
   
    Each module is allocated an extra budget sized at 1/5th of the personnel budget to enable operations.  
      
    This budget is spent with the discretion of the module team. For example, it can be used to pay for transportation, buy personal digital tools to enable work, pay bonuses, etc.
