## **Things to Note:**
* Mercury Chat database is centralized at the moment. The team will look for solutions in the future
* The team is very open to ideas and take community feedback. Needs to be seen if feedback is implemented.
* The UX/UI is slightly rough (small typos & ease of use) since the team is focusing on building functionality at the moment
* The team has kept the rodamap and timeline open for the time being
* Personally I'd recommend the app for individuals and platforms as long as personal/sensitive information is not shared
