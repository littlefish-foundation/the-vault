## Introduction

The era of note-taking during interviews or meetings is now a thing of the past; thankfully, there is a powerful game-changer that helps you do all that.

In this write-up, we'll elaborate on Noty.ai – an AI tool built to make your online meetings and interviews run smoothly without having to worry about jotting down important sections. 

We've all been there! I could recall, early this year I was preparing to start my internship; I did a couple of interviews – sometimes, the hiring managers would tell me to write down some essential things. I'd be honest with you, taking notes with Zoom or Microsoft Team is just not so convenient.

### What does Noty.ai do

Noty.ai was designed to help users automatically generate summaries by transcribing Google Meet, and Zoom calls. The most interesting part of this AI tool is that meeting transcription works in real-time – transcription happens without much delay. Equally, if you probably missed any caption or highlights, the meeting transcription feature automatically saves them even whether you're at the meeting or not.

### Where Can Noty.ai Be Used
Noty.ai plays a vital role in our daily living, and I'd be sharing that with you. Here are some of the best use cases of this software.

1. Project Management: 
Will you agree that poor communication
is a major problem faced by project managers – I can't begin to narrate my experience, though! Being in the same project group with an unserious team member just sucks. Noty.ai can be very useful when it comes to assigning tasks, defining roles and responsibilities, and sharing project milestones.

2. HR and Recruitment
If you want to know how well an employee can fit into your organization, North.ai can help you. This software helps you keep track of your employees' needs and values their concerns. It also allows you to communicate with them on a personal level.

3. Useful For Sales And Discovery
Noty.ai has an automatic superpower follow-up feature that allows you to structure your sales. The call transcription tool summaries conversation; this is one way to create a focused sales tactic to acquire more clients. 

### How To Use The Software

1. The first step to take is to install the Noty.ai Extension from Chrome Webstore.
