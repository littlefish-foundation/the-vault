## Introduction

Docusaurus is a **static-site generator**. It seems very useful because Markdown files can be posted on it. The tool looks like a promising tool for DAOs because it is almost effortless to create Documents and can be used by non-technical people easily.

## How to Use Docusaurus

Docusaurus has a 5 minute gamified tutorial. In order to play it you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer. You can download the lasest version of node.js for your OS.
To try the demo you need to interact with the terminal of your computer. For basic terminal commands please check [here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/).

## What Docusaurus Does

Docusaurus is a platform built with React. You can publish markdown docs and markdown blogs. It is customizable if you are familiar with JS and HTML. The website by default has a sidebar that shows the folders and documents similar to what Obsidian does. Nested Folders are supported. The top bar can provide different pages so you can have a blog page, a document page and more. Creating mor pages and new sidebars requires editing Javascript scripts so there is a need for a technical understanding.

## Comparison to Obsidian

Docusaurus and Obsidian are quite similar. Both platforms
provide static websites for publishing markdown documents. The advantage of obsidian is it provides the user with a platform to write, edit and organize the documents, the writer can see the effects of their work instantly. On the other hand, docusaurus does not have a platform and writing, editing and organizing the documents. So the user has to deal with other tools to write their documents and manually organize them in their OS' explorer, then use the terminal.
Docusaurus interface is much more clear by default and easy to track. Currently in Obsidian, as you read more and more documents, the tabs can be overwhelming.
Linking other documents in Docusaurus is more challenging than Obsidian. To put a link to another document in your website, you have to put directory path of it to the link, in Obsidian doing the same thing only requires typing the documents name.

## Conclusion

Docusaurus is a very useful tool to create a static website. It brings down the technical barrier of making a website significantly and gives a very good customization potential for technical people at the same time.
