**Littlefish** are the actors of the system. They are individuals who want to enable and enact change in the world. They come together on the Littlefish Platform to form colonies.

**Colonies** are groups of littlefish. A group of friends, a digital community, a DAO, a business, a charity organization, … They have common goals to work towards. 

Colonies perform real-world activities. 
-   A group of friends cleaning litter on the beach. 
-   A digital community collaborating towards social/environmental impact.
-   A DAO creating blockchain solutions for a use case.
-   A business announcing/developing/producing a new product. 
- A charity organizing a new campaign to build houses for those in need. 

These activities are documented in whatever way colony members choose - video, image, recordings, tweets, Instagram, … Collected multimedia is then published as NFTs called **Actions**.

Actions are the **Proof of Activity** (PoA). They contain information showing that something has been done to impact the world. Actions can be sold to generate funding. 

The rewards from the sale of Actions are shared between the colony and littlefish. **Everyone earns.**
