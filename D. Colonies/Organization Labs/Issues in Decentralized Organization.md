Decentralized organizations need to reinvent the wheel of operating organizations.

Legacy organizations keep things simple by giving you managers who tell you what to do. What a great idea. Take away the freedom, creativity, and ingenuity of each human being, put them in a special box with a job title and watch them wither away. 

Decentralized organizations need a better way. We need to figure out from the ground up how we organize in a fashion that optimizes for fulfilling human lives filled with joy and fulfillment. 

This is a living document highlighting our research, observations, learnings, and experiments on the issues of decentralized organization.

Scroll, scroll, scroll. I'm bored of this thing after spending 1 and a half seconds looking at it.

## Organizational Structure
Once you take out the boss-employee relationship, you are left structureless. Or are you?
