This guide explains how ComBot can be set and used.

1- You can invite the bot to your server from [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=652938911642943498&permissions=537259088&scope=bot%20applications.commands). You can also see the bot's support page from [this link](https://discord.gg/VdT64GM)

2- After adding the bot you can use the command __/create__ and give a specific name to the connection. This will create the connection for you. This connection name should be unique and maximum 16 characters with only alpha-numerical ones.

3- After creating the connection you have to select it by __/select connection-name__

4- Now that you have created and selected the connection you can add a channel to this connection. For this you have to use __/connect__ command. When you write this command it will prompt you to choose a channel from your server. This will connect your channel to the connection.

You can connect to this channel from any other server simply by repeating the steps above except the second one. Any channel you connect to the same connection will send the messages to each other.
    
Please note that there is 10 minute cooldown between connection creations and one person can only create two connections. For more freedom with the bot you can visit the bot's [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/join/soupcreations)
