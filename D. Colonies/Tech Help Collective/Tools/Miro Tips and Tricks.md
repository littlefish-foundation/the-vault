This post will talk about some tips and tricks you may need while using Miro. If you are new to Miro or trying to expand your knowledge, you might want to check here. If there is anything we are missing from this post please let us know from Discord so we can edit this page. Alternatively, you can always edit yourself as an action.

Let's get started.

###Zooming in
When you select an object and press Ctrl+2 it will fully zoom into the selected object. This can save time instead of zooming frantically. In the picture below, the upper part of it, you may see the object in a very small scale. When you select it press Ctrl+2, the lower part of the picture will be the result.

###Connect Objects
When you click to the dots on the side of an object it will create an empty duplicate and connect these two objects. Whichever side you select, it will create a duplicate on that side. This is valid for almost all object types.

###Change Line Type
One of Miro’s best features is that you can connect any multiple objects with a line. You can change this line type by simply right clicking on it. Also Miro will remember your selection and next time you are drawing a line it will use your last setting.

###Bridging Objects
You can add a bridge from one object to another. This will create a connection between two objects and it will put an arrow on the first selected object. When you press this arrow it will take you to your desired object. Shortcut for this feature is Ctrl+K

###Grouping Objects
You can add multiple objects to a group. With this you can move these objects as a single body. You can always reverse this.

###Opening Mini Map
There is a toggle for a mini map on Miro (yes, like in the games). Pressing M will open the map so that you can see on which part of the board you are. You can even navigate from this map.

###Setting Start View
Normally, Miro board opens from an area where you last closed. You can change this behavior by setting start view. When you select it, the board will open from the place you will have selected.

##Training
You can use some of these tricks by creating your Ikigai from our ‘Roles of Littlefish’ board from [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOWGnhvE=/?share_link_id=771819005586).
We believe this will be a good way to learn more about Miro and Littlefish.
Simply go to the board and create your Ikigai by following guidelines outlined under ‘Get Started with Littlefish Foundation (LFF)’.
