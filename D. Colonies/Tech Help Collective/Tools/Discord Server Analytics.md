**(Aug 15th, 2022; Draft 1)**

Available Options:
1. Discord ‘Enable Community’ Tool
2. Analytics Bot
3. Serverstats Bot (Bonus)
4. **Enable Community Tool:**

Advantages:
* Free and open to use
* Part of discord (not external plugin or bot)
* Displays usage & popularity of all discord channels, individual channel & server interaction insights and many more (List of all insights in images)

Disadvantage:
* Needs a minimum of 500 members in the server to show insights

_Note: If you are the owner of the server, the insights page will display a dropdown menu to choose specific channels and view insights._

_The dropdown menu is not displayed in the images below, because I’m not the server owner)_
