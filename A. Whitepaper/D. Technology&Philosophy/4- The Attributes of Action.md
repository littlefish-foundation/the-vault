## Proof of Activity (PoA)
Littlefish perform activities and document them through video, image, recordings, tweets, instagram, … This record is then published as NFTs called **Actions**.

**Actions** are the Proof of Activity. They contain information showing that something has been done to impact the world. 

For the buyers of Action, the PoA is critical. The activity has already happened. The buyers know exactly what they’re supporting. 

## Notarizing Action
NFTs live for as long as the blockchain lives. The resources in the NFT metadata live for as long as the service keeping them on is live. If this is a traditional backend server, the data is unreliable. It is expected to become offline at some point, taking down the resources - images, videos, … - in it with them. 

The resources in Actions are stored on decentralized, permanent storage. The data lives forever. With timestamps Actions can then be used to verify and validate activities. Action creators can use this attribute to build reputation and trust.

## Digital Business Contracts
When an Action is sold, the payment/reward is shared between the colony and littlefish. The share percentage is a digital business contract, enforced by smart contracts. The littlefish agrees to the colony terms to share rewards each time it produces Action for that colony. Different reward sharing arrangements will create different business models built around sharing.

## Actions Represent Values
Buying an Action means supporting the activity the Action represents. Buying signals the buyer’s social values and puts financial values on them. In their collection, each littlefish will have a mixture of Actions they have produced and supported. They will display a selection of these to the outside world, signaling what they care about, and by how much.

## New Ways To Earn
Act first, produce Action. Get paid when someone buys it. This is a fundamental shift in understanding the concept of payment. There are no hours to agree for, no fixed pay. At least, there doesn’t have to be. 

Littlefish produce Action and others support. This opens up a whole new category of earning, where compensation can be today and years into the future simultaneously. Compensation may grow over time as Action is demanded by a larger network of participants. 

### Creative Entrepreneurship
Action first. Payment later, if there is support. This structure allows littlefish to experiment with ideas around Action, searching for models that draw demand. What can be done with this tooling is very broad. Creative entrepreneurship will result in various new models of earning for individuals. 

### Activism as a Job
The initial use case for Littlefish Foundation in Fund 7 was global activism funding. Transparent, efficient, and on the ground. Actions and colonies take it to the next level. Activist groups, NGOs, individuals who care… They start colonies in Littlefish Foundation. They share their activities, do what they think needs to get done. They get funded directly based on their activities, as they happen.

One clear need for this is in environmental activism. We have polluted the Earth with our garbage and it needs to be cleaned. We all want our beaches, forests, seas, etc. to be clean, yet only a few of us take on the responsibility. We suffer from the tragedy of the commons. With Actions, this can be tackled more effectively. 

This is how simple it is with Actions: A group of friends go to the beach, clean up all the litter, shoot a video, take photos, make GIFs, create an Action. Keyboard activists provide support by marketing Actions, generating art, influencing, and buying/supporting the Actions. The group of friends and the colony are rewarded and incentivized for further Action. **Everyone wins**.

### Investing in Action
NFTs are digital assets that can be owned. Actions are NFTs representing real world activities. Some of these activities will have long standing effects on the world. For some, the value will be misunderstood for a long time, only to be rediscovered in the future. Some will be speculative investments. Some may be valuable in the short term. The range of human activities is broad. So are Actions and their investment potential.

## Social Anonymous Identity
Censorship is suppressing information or ideas that are considered objectionable or dangerous. Governments, organizations, and individuals use censorship to control the spread of information, limit free speech and open communication, and to stop individuals from expressing their ideas. 

In times where individuals’ free speech rights are under attack under authoritarian regimes worldwide, how can blockchains help? With Cardano, there is a basic pseudo-anonymity layer, where the user is only identifiable with their wallet address. With in-depth analysis of chain data the address can be connected to a real world identity, but for most people, most of the time, this is a sufficient level of anonymity.   

What Littlefish Foundation adds to this are Actions and colonies. Actions represent what littlefish have done, and supported in the world. They represent the values of littlefish. The basic layer of anonymity hides their real identity, while allowing them to support and produce Action for what they value. Others can see these and trust the littlefish without knowing their full identity. This allows littlefish under censorship fears to get their message across, and allow finding like-minded people for support.
