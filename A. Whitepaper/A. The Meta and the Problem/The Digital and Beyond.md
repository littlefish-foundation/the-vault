We live in an age of exponential change. Technological progress is disrupting every facet of society, displacing and democratizing power.

With web2, large corporations in many industries have lost their influence. The power of old special interest groups over technology, art, and commerce is now considerably less.

Web2 enabled the proliferation of content, displacing old industries, and allowing everyone to become publishers. Today, knowledge is available to all, for free.

With blockchain information is retained, unmediated, uncensored, and unalterable. Big Tech’s hold on attention is being disrupted and a [[The Bleeding Edge of Organizations and the Big Problem|new model of operation]] for human affairs emerges.
