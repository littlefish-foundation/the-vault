Littlefish Foundation is a decentralized organization, building technologies which align individual actions towards common goals.

We use [[Why Blockchain?|blockchain technology]] to redefine earning relationships between people, work, and organizations, enabling a new model of operation that grants more freedom to participants, while making sure that freedom results in progress towards the goals of the whole.

This model enables:
-   collective initiatives of local or global scale to get worldwide support
-   peer to peer earning relationships without intermediaries
-   greater freedom for all participants
Littlefish Way#
It begins with littlefish. For each greater freedom lies within the journey. The search for [[The Littlefish Way#It Starts within the Individual|**Ikigai**]].

Ikigai: a reason for being. A single-player journey in a multiplayer world. Each littlefish brings their skills, needs, desires, and passion. 

While each brings their own unique value, littlefish [[The Littlefish Way#Self-Actualization Through Community|need others]] for their journey. Littlefish find others in colonies: **the portals to like-minded people**.

In colonies, littlefish who care about similar ideas, have similar values, and want to solve similar problems come together. Littlefish find others with different skills to work towards common goals. 

Together, littlefish are strong! They do activities that [[The Attributes of Action#Actions Represent Values|represent their values]], impacting the world. They produce Action!
