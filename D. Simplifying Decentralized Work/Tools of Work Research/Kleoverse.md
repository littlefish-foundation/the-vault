- Course Badges
- and multiple other Badges showing your contributions to organizations and projects

## Bounties 
As a DAO you can organize your projects tasks in Bounties (manageable pieces of work) for which contributors can apply to. You can distinguish between internal (only for DAO member) and external Bounties that everyone can apply to. 

### Jobs
There is a Job board where organizations can list job offerings and contributors can apply to.

You can search for listed organizations based on 
- Categories (DEFI, PRODUCT, GAMING, COLLECTOR, SOCIAL, PROTOCOL, SOCIAL CAUSE, SERVICE, CLUB)

You can create your own profile page that includes 
- profile pictures

- references to other channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Website, Email, Github, StackOverflow, Lens)
- current work status (hiring, looking for work, providing service) 

## Comparison to DeWork
- It seems that you need an ETH address and one of the supported wallets to participate. 
- A lot of listed organizations don't look very well maintained, including the Kleoverse DAO, that means no jobs and no bounties available .
- As a contributor you can apply to a bounty, but you don't have an overview of the other bounties of a project that are in progress or in review like in DeWork.
- I tried to create a DAO but I get a server error so I cannot test something like bounty creation.
- When you apply to a bounty you have to give your Discord name and some details why you should be chosen for this bounty and links to your previous work and expertise.
