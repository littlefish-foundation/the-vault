## Orientation

This document is a collection point of curated best practices for facilitating zoom meetings.  It can include anything that would help a Zoom / Online meeting organizer, but the scope might creep to general online facilitation best practices.   For beginners mostly, but advanced tips could be good.  This document is open for collaborative editing.  


## From (Discord user Gustapug) The Facilitators’ Collective zoom presentation:

Zoom Basic Tips



* Mute
* Screen Sharing
* Breakout room
* Spotlight
* Agenda on paper
* Zoom Chat: Be careful
* Tell the parameters BEFORE you open the mic
* Show Constant support

Activity



* Explore the options as a moderator
* Find the noise-maker and mute them. Quick!
* Share a portion of the screen and pause it there.  (Share the computer sound)
* Create a breakout room and assign participants
* Move yourself among the rooms and check if everything is alright

**Other suggestions:**



* Have at least 2 facilitators - one to keep an eye on the chat and/or let people in, and one to facilitate discussion
* Welcome people via the chat if they come in late
* Consider how you want to manage settings for people coming in (waiting room? settings so that mic is off when entering? etc)
* Personally, I would say: If you’re running a Zoom session, don’t keep asking people to put their camera on “so I can see your wuvly face” or whatever (I was in a non-Catalyst meeting recently where the facilitator kept doing that, and I thought it was well out of order!) Maybe the guidance could say “Be conscious of all the reasons a person might choose to keep their camera off, and accept their choice without comment” or something…
* For your own security and privacy if you share screen in a meeting - have the window that you are sharing set to full screen so nothing is visible behind it; have it in a window on its own with no other tabs open; hide your menu bar; etc
* If your meeting is being documented, give both audio and video files to the documenter if you can
