Can I be real with you? Artificial Intelligence is one of the best projects that mankind has ever witnessed. Since the inception of AI, human beings have literally put less efforts into some parts of their lives - from AI marketplaces to AI writing tools to AI content generators, all have played a significant role in almost every sphere of life.

Just so you know; not all AI projects were successful, as a matter of fact, nearly 85% AI models have failed over the past few years. Interestingly, AI has helped individuals from all walks of life as well as businesses thriving to go from rock bottom to the top to reach their full potential.

This article is centered on ChatGPT, everybody is talking about this powerful AI tool. If you don't already know what ChatGPT is, you're in the right place. Millions of creators across the continent are already leveraging this viral AI tool.

**Before I further my writing, I'd like to digress a little bit.**

For the sake of clarity, GPT stands for "**Generative Pre-trained Transformer**." ChatGPT is a blockbuster bot developed by OpenAI. GPT debuted in November 2022, and it has been making waves ever since; the list of what ChatGPT does is almost endless.

In my opinion, ChatGPT is undoubtedly the most prominent AI tool I've seen so far, from writing eye-catching emails to blogs to codes - just to mention a few. ChatGPT seems to be the only AI tool that challenges Google's search engine - that's insane!

*It might interest you to know that the entire world is obsessed with ChatGPT right now! Just a few months after its debut, it amass over 100 million users, and it has become a dominant example of an AI content generating tool.*

## Detailed Guide for Using ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an AI tool, but we the users can command it to do exactly what we want. Below, you'll see some examples of good prompt strategies that'll help you get the best possible responses.

*From Linux terminal to tour guide or relationship coach - ChatGPT can play all those roles.*

1. ChatGPT prompts always have the same structure:
* ChatGPT receives a prompt - what role the AI should play.
* Secondly, the prompt state what information the user provided, then what ChatGPT should do with the prompt.
* A rough suggestion that'll guide the AI.
* Lastly, the user/developer inserts his first instruction in a quotation marks.

Like this:

**Act as a Blockchain Marketer**

Your job is to create strategies for running a successful social media campaign focused on introducing Web3 to women in the society. You will engage with the audience by introducing the opportunities Web3 can bring to people, especially women with no prior experience. My first request is "How can women be relevant in the Web3 revolution?"


**Act as a Web Design Consultant**

I will give some insights into a brand looking to design a responsive website for their AI products. Now, your own role is to suggest the must-have features of the website, what design principles could enhance user experience, and what coding languages, and website development tools could be needed to setup the website. My first request is "I need help creating an online marketplace for AI products"


2. We have another example called **chained prompting**.

The *Chained Prompting* mechanism is one of the best ways to command ChatGPT to do exactly what you desire; chained prompting is the process of breaking down complex tasks into different intermediate steps - this way, the AI will generate a concise, customized, and perhaps better results.

3. **Modify Output**
Say you want to prepare a piece of content for all your social media pages such as Reddit, Twitter, or  LinkedIn. You can seamlessly tell ChatGPT to adapt to the tone, and description of formatting for the target channel.

*For example, formatting a tweet for Twitter*

"I want you to generate a couple of Twitter threads related to Web3. Let the maximum length of each thread not exceed 280 characters. Each thread should be concise as possible as it'll be tailored to individuals with no prior experience in Web3."

You can use this as a template for other social media networks.

3. **Format Output**
Just so you know; GPT needs a good formatting hints to produce better responses. You can tell the AI to format the responses in a special order. Such as adding lists, headings, bold, or italic tags as well as tables.

For example, "*I want you to make a list of the top 10 best AI tools that will change the world in 2023, write a heading, and a few paragraphs. I want the document in Markdown format.*"

The basic version of ChatGPT is totally free to use at this point; according to my research, OpenAI spends close to $3 million every month to keep ChatGPT running on the internet. Progressively, OpenAI recently announced **ChatGPT** **Plus** - a paid version of the software. The company plans to charge $20 per month when it enters the market. Truth be told; the paid version would guarantee access to new sophisticated features, and faster responses.

## Detailed Guide on How Reliable ChatGPT Information Is

OpenAI has acknowledged as much, in some cases, ChatGPT would write applauding piece of contents for you, and also , nonsensical answers could be included in the results it generates. Sometimes ChatGPT's results can be misleading, and inaccurate. Although, it gives correct answers to non-complex questions you may throw at it.

Since the launch of the tool, many people including myself have tried to experiment, and play around with the software to see what good it can bring. To be honest with you, the chatbot is exceptional. 

Just like the famous law of gravity; whatever goes up must come down. That being said; your input determines your output. The accuracy of information generated by this AI tool cannot always be trusted.

Some creator describe GPT as a source of inspiration - the software was trained on a vast amount of information, so it basically has knowledge of almost any question you may throw at it. 

## How to Verify ChatGPT Responses 

When using this tool, it is not a good idea to work with the results without checking the response against other sources. ChatGPT taking over Google search engine has been a controversial topic for months now.

Google search engine is still one of the most reliable sources of information, and its one of the best tools to use when comparing ChatGPT responses.

Sometime ago in late 2022, Wikipedia was my main source of information for my CCTV project. 

On the other hand, podcasts, and original research articles can help significantly to compare ChatGPT responses on specific questions. 

## Some Possible Problems One Encounter While Using This Tool

As there are many advantages of the AI game-changer - there are also many hurdles users face while using this Chatbot.

A few days ago, I was reading some messages on my Discord app; boom I stumbled upon a message "**ChatGPT** **is down**," This AI tool has become a global sensation, and many people from all walks of life want to use it.

1. Many people attempting to use the software at the same time usually cause the server to run slowly; and sometimes it will be down for several hours - if you're patient enough, you'd have to wait for a long time before you can access it.
2. The demand for ChatGPT is so high, OpenAI often takes the software offline for maintenance, and this has been happening repeatedly since its launch.
3. Just so you know; the chatbot is not always 100% correct, so users need to be on the look out for these possible errors. Momentarily, the chatbot could provide obsolete results when a user inputs an incorrect prompt - ChatGPT is a programmed piece of software; keep in mind, if you do not input correct prompts, be sure to get incorrect responses that could even get you frustrated anyway.

In addition to my writeup, ChatGPT seems to be struggling with more complex topics or ideas. Since the project is still in it's early stage, the responses might not really suit commercial needs. And, the risk of plagiarism is very high. In some cases, two persons could use the same prompts unknowningly - the chatbot will automatically produce the same responses.
