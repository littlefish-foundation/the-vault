> "**Clarity** is the simplest workspace for remote teams. Easily plan projects, track tasks, and stay organized with **a simple all-in-one workspace that automates tedious project management work**."

### ⚒️Here's how it works - 
*Base* is the starting or top level view. Each Base has a home, roadmap, wiki, groups and roles section / menu item.    

*Home* is a place to add documents as well as resources like web links and hashtags (which search the entire base).  Collections are placed on the home area (and can be created / edited there).

*Roadmap* is table of tasks with milestone sections.

*Wiki* is like a library or a like the Littlefish vault, a knowledge base for documents and resources that grows organically with the organizations work. 

*Groups & Roles* - are sort of like folders for 'Bases'.  You can create several groups.  Each group has an overview (an activity feed), work (task kanban board or a projects list ), Docs (a listing of documents) and Settings page.  

*Settings* - Each base has privacy settings.  Token gating is built in.  You can have a custom domain name.  There are default roles and roles can be customized, also with token requirements (ETH based tokens and NFTs).   There are three core plug-ins at this time (March 2023) - Rewards, Milestones and Weekly. Weekly is a weekly newsletter / announcement feature.   There is a discord integration (similar to Dework)

*Additional* - Views, Tags and Payouts.  

### Creating Documents and other actions
Clarity uses a block based editor. This allows for commenting, block level linking, and on the fly task creation. Uses MD formatting in a WYSIWYG editor.  Title and tagging is done in a semi - automatic way.

**Other actions:**
Tagging creates a page in the wiki and in the Tags view.  But I can't find a section that actually says 'Wiki' - so it seems that the only way to navigate it is via tags.

## ⚖️Comparison to Dework. Why should we or should we not switch to this platform
Dework and Clarity are similar and perform many of the same tasks.  

Clarity seems to be more 'user friendly', less intimidating, and less polished.  The app doesn't feel as mature as Dework.  The admin seems straightforward and does advanced things (like token gating) in a simple way. I am not sure if Dework has a token-gating feature, that is to say permissions set according to a token held in a wallet. You can sign in to Dework with a wallet.  

For instance, the Kanban / Tasks board on Clarity is more intuitive to me than Dework.  The Clarity interface is cleaner and less confusing. The Dework interface seems overloaded and unfocused.

Clarity's focus seems to be on 'contributor community' and the sub-groups within the larger community.  This would be equivalent to the working teams in typical DAO structures.  Sharing and visibility between groups is a highlighted feature. For instance, if there is a goal or proposal that includes work from several different 'groups' or 'pods' then the activity can be shared on the community wide roadmap. 

Payouts can be done at the group level.  

The power of the Clarity might be in the document creating features, which are not available in Dework.  Many communities use a separate app for document sharing (GoogleDocs, HackMD, Obsidian, Dropbox, etc.) and the features may overlap.  However there may be a workflow that includes Clarity with these other apps. Perhaps plugins / integrations are on the way. 

Dework uses the power of the platform of other Network Orgs.  A user's profile on Dework is accessible on all other organizations using Dework.  Clarity is not set up this way, as I understand it.   

Clarity makes onboarding a priority thru a wiki system and configurable 'Base home screen'.  You can pin resources to a 'collection' which can include several types of resources like web links, documents, etc. 

*[Dework.xyz](https://Dework.xyz):*
-   Allows users to create tasks and assign them to team members, as well as set deadlines and priorities.
-   Offers multiple views, filters and sorts where users can see all their tasks and deadlines in one place. Kanban and List views are featured.
-   Has a real-time progress tracker that allows team members to see each other's progress and stay up-to-date on the status of a project.
-   Offers the ability to create projects and group tasks by project.

*Clarity.so:*
-   Allows users to create articles, which can be used as tasks or action items, and assign them to team members.
-   Offers a list and Kanban board view that allows users to see all the articles in a project, as well as their status (such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done").
-   Provides a search function that allows team members to find relevant articles quickly.
-   Has a user permissions system that allows administrators to control who can edit and access articles.
-   Offers the ability to create and manage projects.

Overall, both Dework.xyz and Clarity.so provide tools for managing tasks and coordinating group work, but they do so in different ways. Dework.xyz offers a more traditional task and project management system, while Clarity.so focuses more on creating and organizing knowledge bases and action items.

## :shrug: Possible Problems
Moving to another tool has inherent problems.  However the two tools have many of the same metaphors - Tasks, assignees, etc.  There are slight differences in terms.  For instance, Dework spaces are similar to Clarity groups.  A 'Base' in Clarity would be similar to an account in Dework. It's worth noting that both tools integrate with Discord.  

I don't think it would be huge shock to move to another system. The block based editor might be a challenge for some.  A fresh start might be an incentive to the community to embrace the task / project management tool.  

##  Notes :pushpin: and Questions:question::
:pushpin:Creating tasks is similar to Dework.  You can include tasks in documents with a simple slash command.  The work flow of creating, claiming, commenting is similar to Dework.  

:question: Can other members edit my docs?  Do I have a sharing control like in Google Docs?
	Yes, it is similar to Google Docs and HackMD in this respect. 

:pushpin: I don't see the activity screen in my Base or Group.  

:question:What's up with the plugin structure?  Cycles plugin for sprints?

:pushpin: I can't find a section that actually says 'Wiki' - so it seems that the only way to navigate it is via tags. Is there a Wiki section to explore all documents of the wiki?  

:question: Can I export my documents as standard .md files?
