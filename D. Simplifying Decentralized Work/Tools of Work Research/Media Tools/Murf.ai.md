## Glossary

### text to speech
Text to speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. It is a computer-based process that uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to produce a synthesized voice that can read out the text aloud. The TTS system works by analyzing the text and identifying its structure and context to produce a spoken output that mimics human speech. This technology is often used to provide voice prompts for automated customer service systems, create audiobooks, assist people with visual impairments, and even to read out text messages and emails for hands-free convenience. 

### voice cloning
Voice cloning is a technology that uses artificial intelligence to create a synthetic copy of a person's voice. It involves training a computer system to analyze and learn the unique voice patterns, intonations, and speech characteristics of a target speaker. The system then uses this data to generate a computer-generated voice that sounds similar to the target speaker. Voice cloning has a wide range of applications, such as in text-to-speech systems, chatbots, personal assistants, and voice-over work. It can be used to create a digital voice replica of a person, which can be useful for generating voice content, voice commands, and other voice-based applications. Voice cloning technology is still in its early stages, and there are ongoing debates about its ethical implications and potential misuse.

### voice over video
Voice-over video refers to a technique in which a recorded voice is played over a video, explaining or commenting on what is being shown on the screen. It is a popular method of storytelling and is often used in documentaries, instructional videos, and presentations. In voice-over videos, the audio is usually recorded separately from the video and then synchronized with the visual content during the editing process. The voice-over artist can provide additional information, insights, or explanations about the video content, making it more engaging and informative for the viewers. Voice-over video can be an effective way to convey complex information, communicate with audiences who may be hearing-impaired, and add an emotional or persuasive element to the visuals.

### voice changer
A voice changer is a software or hardware device that can alter the sound of a person's voice in real-time or during post-processing. The software can manipulate the pitch, tone, and tempo of a person's voice to make them sound like a different gender, age, or species. The hardware device is usually a small gadget that can be attached to a microphone, and the software can be used with a computer, mobile phone, or gaming console. Voice changers are commonly used for entertainment purposes, such as creating humorous or scary voice effects, playing pranks on friends, and enhancing the gaming experience. Voice changers are also used in professional settings, such as in the movie and animation industry, to create unique and authentic voice effects for characters.
