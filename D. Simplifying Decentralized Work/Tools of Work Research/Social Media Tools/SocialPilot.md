## Introduction

SocialPilot is a social media management tool. It aims to simplify social media management by automating content posting on one or more different social media platforms. It allows the management of multiple platforms, management of Ad Accounts for social media accounts, and a team can manage the same SocialPilot account.

## How to Use

SocialPilot supports many social media platforms. These are:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest
- Google Business Profile
- Instagram
- Youtube
- TikTok
- Tumblr

The tool offers a good range of customization of content. For each social media platform, there are specified customization options. One can also do editing on their media on the image editor provided by SocialPilot.
The content can also be posted on a range of different social media accounts, for example, you can post an Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn post at once, and each post can be customized further for different platforms. The post can also be scheduled for maximum interaction. One of the best options is, sharing a post multiple times a day. This is important because you can hit the prime times of different markets easily.

A short and good tutorial video can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kCJfvEx_I&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.socialpilot.co%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)

### Analytics

SocialPilot also has an analytics service. Users can track how effective their posts are easily. For example, on Twitter, you can view retweets, favorites and replies, and more.

### Bulk Scheduling

One can also prepare the content they want to post let’s say for a week as a CSV(Comma-separated values) file. The format for a row is:

**"content","image URL","post time(year-month-day hour-minute)","column header(not a requirement)"**

One can create a file with 500 rows with different posts and upload it to SocialPilot and it posts the content according to your schedule.

### Pricing

SocialPilot offers four different plans. The pricing ranges between 30 USD and 200 USD. Depending on the client’s team size and the monthly generated content, one of four plans can be suitable.

## How DAOs Can Utilize SocialPilot

Visibility is as important as good work. No matter how good a product of a DAO is, if it cannot be visible online, it can never reach its full potential. Social media management is a very important part of any organization and DAOs are no exception. I believe all organizations need to use these kinds of tools to maximize their potential and SocialPilot is one of the best examples of social media management tools.
