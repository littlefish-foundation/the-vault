Here is an image of the Dashboard.  Notice across the left hand menu, at the top you see the 'group' folder with your organization name.  Under that you can see the following menu items - Dashboard, Smart Inbox, Tasks, Feeds, Publishing, Listening, Reports, People, reviews.

### Compose a Post

In creating your first post, you get to know Publishing workflows, SproutTags (labels and campaigns for filtering and analyzing posts),  and post scheduling.

Briefly, the "publishing workflows" allow for steps in the process of creating, editing, and approving posts - before the post is published.  This can be as simple as an approval step from a manager, but could be more involved.

"Sprouttags" are labels internal to the Sprout Social tool.  These tags are not in the actual post. They are labels and campaigns which are ways to group, to report and to analyze the posts.

The "When to post section"'" offers three options - "Immediately", "Auto Schedule with SproutQueue", and "Specific Days and Times".  There are options for scheduling more than one time for the same post, which is beneficial for DAOs with membership and customers in multiple time zones.  There are options to "Bulk schedule" posts from a spreadsheet file up to 350 at a time.

### Publishing Section
