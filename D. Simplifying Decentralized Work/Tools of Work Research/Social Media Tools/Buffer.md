## 1. App Summary
---
Buffer is an app that offers various features to help teams manage their social media accounts efficiently. One of its key benefits is the ability to set permissions levels and approval flows, which allows teams to work autonomously without excessive oversight. Buffer also provides automated reports that showcase a team's work and saves time by publishing content for them. Additionally, Buffer suggests appropriate hashtags and channels for content distribution and helps determine the best time to publish posts for maximum impact. Lastly, Buffer also offers an AI Assistant (beta) feature that provides various content creation tools. With this feature, users can generate new content ideas, repurpose existing posts, and re-write drafts in different styles.

    4. Channel Management: Adding and deleting various social media channels/platforms.
* **Analytics**
  The analytics are very similar to Instagram and YouTube analytics but the advantage is that the user can access analytics from all connected platforms. The analytics are also categorized into campaigns, user accounts, and platforms.
* **Engagement**
  This section allows you to engage with the community by replying to comments across platforms and groups.
* **Landing Page**
  Buffer allows users and marketing teams to create a quickfire landing page with images and links. This is useful for individuals and teams that already have a website, and especially for those without one. 
  
## 3. Use Cases for DAOs
