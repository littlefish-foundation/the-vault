## Progress this month

### Module 1: Legal Research
Read about this module here: [[NewOrder - Modules#**Module 1: Legal Research**]]

The legal team reworked parts of the DAO Framework paper with additional feedback we collected from our team. **3 - Legal frameworks for Decentralized Organizations**

You can find that document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWkk79LRLfhjWcM6VjV97wlQUv9jbnoO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105493237723142439851&rtpof=true&sd=true). The document will soon be put on the Vault.

We've specified the next research paper on: 1 - Legal status of LFF Action NFTs. [Here](https://littlefishfoundation.notion.site/Research-Specification-The-Legal-Status-of-Action-NFTs-84de61eefe8d4ca1baca0c1eb828a6c9)'s the specification for those who wish to take a sneak peek. And feel free to drop any comments so we can adjust the scope of the work.

### Module 2: Consultation and Educational Workshops

We had no workshops this month. We will have our second workshop in a Catalyst After Town Hall session on DAO Frameworks in the coming weeks.

## Discussion
This work is still going slowly. But we established a full schedule and plan with the legal team to speed things up, so hopefully things will go smoother from now on.
