#LFF-tools 

Technological progress is rapid in the Ocean. Everything changes quickly. New methods of organization emerge, existing solutions crash and burn, ingenious innovation opens new avenues of thought. To keep up, **information needs to be updated** and in short intervals.

Our solution is evolving documentation, kept on Obsidian. Our docs will evolve in two ways. First way is to iterate through our documentation. An individual will write a doc, another will use it, add missing information, clarify, and polish it. If new information is available on a particular topic we’re interested in, we’ll add it to our existing knowledge base, updating our information. Over time our info will grow and show the story of different experiments in the Ocean.

Second is a feature of Obsidian. Obsidian’s graph view shows all files as nodes, and all links as lines to other nodes. As of 15th of June 2022, this is what that means on the LFF Vault. We’ll update this to show evolution on Obsidian by the end of the proposal window.
